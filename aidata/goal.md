# WhatsApp Chat RMD - Project Overview

## What We're Building

An intelligent WhatsApp assistant that learns from your conversations and helps you stay on top of important messages, tasks, and reminders - all automatically.

## Core Goals

### 1. **Smart Message Understanding**
- Automatically read and understand every WhatsApp message you receive
- Identify what's important: tasks, deadlines, questions, commitments, or just casual chat
- Remember context from past conversations to understand references and ongoing discussions

### 2. **Proactive Intelligence**
- Remind you about upcoming deadlines mentioned in chats
- Alert you when someone asks a question you haven't answered
- Notice when you've committed to doing something and track if it's done
- Catch important messages that might get buried in group chats

### 3. **Instant Notifications**
- Push notifications directly to your browser or phone
- Smart filtering - only notify about things that actually matter
- Customizable triggers based on your preferences

### 4. **Natural Conversation Memory**
- Remember what people told you weeks or months ago
- Understand relationships between different conversations
- Connect dots across multiple chats (e.g., if someone mentions a project in one chat and asks about it later in another)

## How It Works (User Perspective)

### **Automatic Triggers**

**Time-Based:**
- Get reminded about meetings mentioned in chats
- Alerts for deadlines discussed with colleagues
- Follow-ups on promises you made ("I'll send that file tomorrow")

**Event-Based:**
- Someone asks you a direct question → Get notified if you don't respond within a set time
- Important keywords appear → Instant notification (e.g., your name, "urgent", "deadline")
- Task assignments → Automatic tracking until completion

**Context-Based:**
- Conversations that need your attention → Sorted by priority
- Unread messages from important contacts → Highlighted
- Group messages where you're specifically mentioned → Extracted and prioritized

### **What You Can Do**

1. **Ask Questions About Your Chats**
   - "What did Sarah say about the meeting?"
   - "When is the project deadline?"
   - "What tasks am I supposed to complete this week?"
   - "Who asked me for that document?"

2. **Get Summaries**
   - Daily digest of important conversations
   - Missed messages while you were away
   - Action items extracted from all chats

3. **Set Smart Reminders**
   - Based on conversation context
   - Recurring for ongoing commitments
   - Triggered by specific people or keywords

4. **Track Conversations**
   - See conversation threads across different chats
   - Follow project discussions automatically
   - Never lose track of multi-day conversations
